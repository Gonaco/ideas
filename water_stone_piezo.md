# Water and stone - piezoelectric effect?

[Piezoelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity) describes the relation between pressure in solid materials and electric charge. Is it possible that geological processes make pressure on rocks, creating electric charge that is then transferred to water? This might be a natural cause of many so called "healing springs".
