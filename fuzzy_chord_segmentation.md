# Fuzzy chord segmenation

- would it be possible to segment chord in a song in a fuzzy way?
    - ie. the segments needn't be disjoint
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_clustering
- would it be possible to perform multi-level (hierarchical) segmentation?
    - on one level there would be a longer block with a simple chord
    - one another level this block would be composed of smaller block with more complex chord - interaction of basic chords and melody
- how to discriminate between chords and melody?
    - sometimes melody is quite independent on the underlying chords
    - sometimes chords are made of melody
