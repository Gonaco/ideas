# Room resonance

## Task

Given a room (eg. a toilet) find its resonant frequency.

## Solution

Make a (mobile) app that:

- plays a sinusoids
  - for various frequencies through the frequency space
- listens for the room response
- detects a resonance and stabilizes on it

It can show:

- the found resonant frequency, if any
- plot the response profile for a frequency space
