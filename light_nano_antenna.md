# Nanotube waveguide antenna array for visible light

Just as there as [waveguide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide)s for microwaves in the WiFi band could waveguides be scaled to work in the visible light band?

## Principle

Waves radiate from an ideal source isotropically (in all directions). The function of a waveguide is to guide waves in a single direction - typically using the mechanism of total internal reflection.

A waveguide antenna transfers energy between electric power in a conductive medium (such as a metal wire) and electromagnetic waves in a non-conductive medium (such as air).

## Scales

The width of a waveguide is typically in the same order of magnitude as the wavelength.

So wavelength of 2.4 GHz WiFi microwaves is about 12.5 cm.

For visible light in the 430â€“790 THz band the wavelength is about 380 to 700 nm. The scale of visible light is 180000-330000x smaller than of WiFi.

A waveguide antenna would thus need to be manufactured via nanotechnology.

It consists of a small dipole and a cylinder waveguide. The size of both is tuned to the frequency band is should operate on.

Currently nanotechnology is probably best explored for carbon which is a semi-conductor. However, typical waveguides are made of full conducting metals.

Since a single waveguide on this scale would be very small it can transfer only a little energy. Thus a large array of small elements would be probably needed in practice.

## Possible usages

- emit light based on electric power
    - lighting
    - display
- absorb light and induce electric power
    - sensor
    - power source

## Questions

- could this work?
- what should be the shape?
- in case of an array, how to synchronize all the elements?
- what materials would need to be used?
- how to manufacture the device?
- how to generate electric power at the scale of hundereds of THz?
- how to convert the electricity back to lower frequencies?

I came across this idea sometime back around in 2005 when playing with WiFi networks. Since then it seems there was some research in this area.
