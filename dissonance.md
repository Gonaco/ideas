# Dissonance exploration

- how to model dissonance?
- what is the threshold between consonance, roughness and dissonance?
- how dissonance behaves between complex harmonic tones?
- take some measure of dissonance
- generate sounds of two tones
    - in the range of at least one octave
    - try tones with variour harmonic profiles (colors)
- measure dissonance between various intervals
    - continuous
    - selected - via equal temperament, just intonation
- what's the effect of phase?
- what's the effect of the fundamental frequency?
    - does dissonance change depending on the band?
- make a time-series of a dissonance measure and plot it
- it is true that dissonance of frequency-pairs could be added together? does some total dissonance increase?
