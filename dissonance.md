# Dissonance exploration

- take some measure of dissonance
- generate sounds of two tones
    - in the range of at least one octave
    - try tones with variour harmonic profiles (colors)
- measure dissonance between various intervals
    - continuous
    - selected - via equal temperament, just intonation
- what's the effect of phase?
- what's the effect of the fundamental frequency?
    - does dissonance change depending on the band?
