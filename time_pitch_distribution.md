# Time-pitch distribution

A kind of modified discrete time-frequency distribution.

How much energy is in each pitch bin? Where "pitch" refers to one of the [continuous pitch spaces](continuous_pitch_spaces.md).

The distribution could be either over the whole track, continuous or something in between - split into time blocks. Time blocks could be either regular in time or aligned to beats/bars/verses etc.

Various notes could be identified both in time and pitch. Eg. which notes appeach in this bar/verse?
