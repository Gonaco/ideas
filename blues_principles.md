# Blues principles

- blues is based on the ambivalence between major and minor tonality
- in blues dominant chords are used very much, because:
    - have major third (like major chord) and minor seventh (like minor chord)
    - those somes are very close to actual natural harmonics

- 12-bar blues chord progressions modulate between three "keys"
