# Realistic bokeh post-processing on camera-phone images

- "BokehLab for Android/iOS"
- goal: realistic bokeh on camera phone images
- they have small sensor -> wide depth of field
- we'd like shallow DoF and nice bokeh
- we could also like tilt-shift
- it could be post-processed using techniques described in the BokehLab project
    - image-based ray tracing
    - spreading filter
- we need a depth map and one or more images
