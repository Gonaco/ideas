# Fractional Fourier Transform and Linear Canonical Transform for audio

[Fractional Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Fourier_transform) (FRFT) is a generalization of FT. In a high-level term is rotates the time-frequency plane about continuous angles. FT is just a special case of rotation about 90 deg (IFT rotates 90 deg back).

Even FRFT can be generalized further to [Linear Canonical Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_canonical_transformation) (LCT). It provides a general linear transformation of the time-frequency plane.

Could FrFT or LCT be utilized somehow in audio processing?
