# Adaptive CQT

- in parts of the spetrum without much harmonic content coarser bins would be sufficient
- conversely, in parts with a lot of harmonic content it would be better to have finer bins
- what is a sufficient fineness of bins when we don't get more information?
- how to use bins with variable bandwith and central frequency without the need of recomputing the spectral kernels and storing them all in memory?
- isn't [multi-focal reassigned spectrogram](multi_focal_time_frequency_analysis.md) a better alternative?
