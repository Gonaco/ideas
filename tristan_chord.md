# Tristan chord

- Fm7b5 in C key (IVm7b5)
- in fact it is VIIm7b5 in Gb key, which is the mirror key to C
- it contains the B and F tones which are the yellow tones shared by the mirror keys
- it can be thought as a variation to IIb7 (tritone-substituted dominant)
- also it is similar to Iidim
- can be resolved to E7 and then to Am7
    - it takes the role of VIIm7b5
- Fm7b5 has the same relation to Bm7b5 as Db7 to G7, it is a tritone substitution of VIIm7b5

Mysterious Tristan chord? Just a tritone substitution for VII half-dim!

- background
    - Tristan und Isolde
    - the actual sound,notation and chords
    - the inferred key
    - the repetition in another key
- previous interpretations
- my interpretation
    - image of the linear chord timeline (like Beatles songs were visualized)
    - animation of the chord progression
    - tone circle
    - mirror key
    - tritone substitution
        - commonly for V7 -> IIb7
        - used heavily in jazz
        - [some example]
        - it contains a tritone, the other tones are taken from V7 in the mirror key
        - mirror key - rotation by 6
        - tritone interval maps to itself
        - the other diatonic chord which contains the tritone interval is VIIm7b5 (half diminished)
        - it can also be tritone-substituted: VII7m7b5 -> IVm7b5
    - and IVm7b5 in this context is exactly the Tristan chord!
        - very simple interpretation
        - purely the key, a single chorss and its function, no magic or exceptions
        - it doesn't mean the other interpretations are wrong, they're just more brittle
    - further questions?
        - in which other musical pieces such a chord is utilized? also in jazz?
