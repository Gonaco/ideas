# Mastering quality

Is it possible that the quality of music mastering directly correlates with separability of various instruments?

For example:

- in a well-mastered track all instruments are easily separably by human brain
- in a badly masterd track instruments clash with each other resulting in a "big ball of mud"

Is it possible that the quality of music mastering directly correlates with high dynamic range of intensities?
