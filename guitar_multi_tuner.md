# Guitar Multi-Tuner

- tune multiple strings at once
- have an overview of how strings are tuned
- make tuning exceptionally precise
- see if the partials are really harmonic
- make a visual map of guitar intonation (tuning of each fret over the whole neck)
- visualize tuning of whole chords
- allow tuning to minimize total dissonance
- compare different chord voicings with regard to dissonance
- each string can be recognized automatically by its timbre
- the user could select the desired
    - tuning of string (eg. EBGDAE, DADGAD, etc.),
    - tuning system (equal temperament, just intonation, etc.)
    - reference frequency (440 Hz, etc.)
- the reference frequency could be detected from the played music (e.g. the rest of the band)
- visualize the dynamics of the string frequency
    - as in changes over the pluck
