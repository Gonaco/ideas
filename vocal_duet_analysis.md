# Vocal duet analysis

Let's have a two female singers singing a duet.

- Why it sounds so cool?
- What are the exact intervals of their tones?
- Are they snapped to the equal temperament tuning or are they different?
- Roughly by what intervals are they related (what's the distribution)?
- What about the dissonance?
- Is there lower dissonance with male/female duet (when they sing in different octaves)?

Examples:
- Corale: In Chist Alone
- Corale: Půlnoční session (Marien)
- Corale: Šla Maria do kláštera
