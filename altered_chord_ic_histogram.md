# Interval-class histogram for altered dominant chord

An interesting thing.

- take altered chord - `X7#9`
- its interval class histogram is `111111`
    - `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5:1, 6:1}`
- it contains each interval class exactly once
- interval class
    - the shortest distance between two tones on the 12-tone circle
    - range: 0-6
- in the above example we omit the unison (interval class 0)
    - however it is trivial to add it and the histogram's property keeps holding
