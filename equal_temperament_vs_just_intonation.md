# Equal temperament vs. just intonation

- compare both tunings
- what is similar, what differs?
- generate some chords in both tunings
    - from:
        - plain sine tones
        - complex tones with harmonics
    - set of frequences
        - visualize
    - synthesized sound
- how does a sequence of tones sound?
- how does chords sound?
- measure dissonance
- compare partials that are very near
