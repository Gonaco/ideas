# Tale of a tree

[Imagine a movie.]

[some millions years ago, a timer on a heads-up display]

A view on an ancient forest. Camera goes slowly down. In the background there are some dinosaurs. After a while camera focuses on a cone on the tree. It opens up and a seed starts falling down. It lands on the ground. There's a great fire in which the mother tree dies. After the fire the seed starts to grow. It sprouts first leaves and quickly grows up. The dinosaurs are dead and some rat-like mammals appear. The tree keeps on growing. There are some beasts and then hominids appear. An ice age comes and everywhere is snow. The tree keep on growing, albeit very slowly. The ice age ends and it is warm again. The humans start making weapons and kill each other - with sharp branches, stones, iron scythes, swords, rifles. They burn some trees in the neighborhood, then they cut them using axes. Then using gasoline saws. Finally they cut the tree and a robotic arm puts it on a truck full of other trees. The camera goes up. The truck drives on a dusty road till the horizon. It lands on a train and lands in a paper factory. Tree tree gets mashed up by some machine and it is cooked into paper. Rolls of paper are reeled and loaded into another truck. It gets unloaded in a supermarket. Some market assistant puts a pack of paper rolls into a rack. Some customer takes it and puts it into a shopping cart. The timer greadually slows down and converges towards zero. The person arrives home, unpacks the roll and puts it near a toilet. A child makes a shit and cleans the ass with the roll of the toilet paper. Zero time.

[The end.]
